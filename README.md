This project is based upon
[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) and adds more
structure for SCSS and JavaScript files, includes build tasks and a whole lot
more.

## Dependencies

You will need to install some stuff, if you haven't already:

Majors:

* Node.js
* Ruby

Secondaries:

* Node: npm
* Ruby: Sass 3.3.x

After you've set this stuff up please run

	$ npm install -g grunt-cli bower

This installs the Grunt command line tools and bower.
Afterwards please run

	$ npm install

in your project's directory.
This will install all the things you need for running the grunt-tasks
automatically and all Bower components defined in `bower.json`.

Also it will create a folder `components` which holds all vendor dependencies
managed by Bower.


### Troubleshooting

If running the install does not work, please try running it as with
admin-rights:

	$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli


## Browser support

* Chrome
* Firefox 4+
* Internet Explorer 8+
* Opera 12+
* Safari 5+

## Yeoman Generator-INIT

## Contribute

Please help making this project better and [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) with
your knowledge.


## CSS

We are currently working with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (in its dialect
SCSS) and do not use CSS directly. Please do not edit the CSS-files in any case
but search the corresponding `.scss` file and edit it accordingly. If you are
not familiar with SCSS you can write pure CSS which is actually valid SCSS.

However all `.scss`-files are compiled into one file called `main.css` in the
`css`-folder. There is a productive-version (means minified), too.

You can find more information about the installation process of Sass and the
usage of SCSS in the [Sass Tutorial](http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html).


## JS

We use jQuery, Modernizr (custom build via Grunt) and RequireJS.

Please use JSHint for your JavaScript before you commit. You can use the
Grunt-task `jshint` for this. It is also integrated in `grunt watch`.


## Creating a Build

Please use [Grunt.js](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) for building a
production-state of a website. The `Gruntfile.js` has tasks for concatenating
and minifing CSS and JavaScript.

Additional information on this project is stored in `package.json`.
